## **Exploratory Data Analysis using Python**
We began with data preparation and cleaning with python:

 - **Data Loadind**: Imported dataset using `pandas`.
   
 - **Initail Exploration**: Used `df.info()` to check structure `df.describe()` for summary statistics.
   
 - **Missing Data Handling**: Checked for null values and imputed values in the `Review Rating` using the median rating of each product category.
   
 - **Column Standardization**: Renamed columns to snake case for better readability and documentation
   
 - **Feature Engineering**:
   
   - Created `age_group` column by binning customer ages.
     
   - Created `purchase_frequency_days` column from purchase data.
     
 - **Data Consistency Check**: Verified if `discount_applied` and `promo_code_used` were redundant; dropped `promo_code_used`.
   
 - **Database Integration**: Connected Python script to PostgreSQL and loaded the cleaned DataFrame into the database for SQL analysis.

## Data Analysis using SQL
We performed structured analysis in PostgreSQL to answer key business questions:

1. **Revenue by Gender**: Compared total revenue generated by male vs. female.
   
2. **High Spending Discount Users**: Identified customers how used discounts but still spent above the average purchase amount.
   
3. **Top 5 Products By Rating**: Found products with the highest average review ratings.

4. **Shipping Type Comparison**: Compared average purchase amounts between standard and express shipping.

5. **Subscribers Vs Non-subscribers**: Compared average spend and total revenue across subscription status.

8. **Top 3 Products Per Category**: List the most purchased products within each category.

9. **Repeat Buyers and Subscription**: checked whether customers with > 5 purchases are more likely to subscribe.
