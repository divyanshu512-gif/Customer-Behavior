## **Exploratory Data Analysis using Python**
We began with data preparation and cleaning with python:

 - **Data Loadind**: Imported dataset using `pandas`.
   
 - **Initail Exploration**: Used `df.info()` to check structure `df.describe()` for summary statistics.

 - **Missing Data Handling**: Checked for null values and imputed values in the `Review Rating` using the median rating of each product category.
   
 - **Column Standardization**: Renamed columns to snake case for better readability and documentation
   
 - **Feature Engineering**:
   
   - Created `age_group` column by binning customer ages.
     
   - Created `purchase_frequency_days` column from purchase data.
     
 - **Data Consistency Check**: Verified if `discount_applied` and `promo_code_used` were redundant; dropped `promo_code_used`.
   
 - **Database Integration**: Connected Python script to PostgreSQL and loaded the cleaned DataFrame into the database for SQL analysis.
